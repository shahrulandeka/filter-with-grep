<h1>[Mini] Filter with Grep</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab example, I run through how to filter with grep, a Linux command that helps with filtering information. We will also be using piping to search for files and to return specific information from files. <br/>
At the end of this lab example, we would have practical experience in using grep to: <br/>
-Search for specific information contained in files, and <br/>
-find files containing specific strings that were piped into grep.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Bash Shell</b> 
- <b>Oracle VM Virtual Box</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b> (22H2)

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<br />
1. Firstly, we would use the pwd command to know which directory we are currently working in:
 <br/>
  For this example, we would use cd command to switch into the "logs" directory.
  <br/>
  Then, use the ls command to list the content of the current directory.
  <br/>
  Use the grep command to filter the server_logs.txt file, and return all lines containing the text string "error".

<br />
<br />
2. Now we want to navigate to the /home/analyst/reports/users directory: <br/>
  Type in cd . . to go up one directory. <br/>
  Type in cd reports, followed by cd users to reach the correct directory. <br/>
  Using the pipe character ( | ), pipe the output of the ls command to the grep command to list only the files <br/> containing the string Q1 in their names.

<br />
<br />
3. Let's try this again:  <br/>
  List the files that contain the word access in their names

<br />
<br />
4. For this example, let's search for information contained in user files and report on users<br/>
  that were added and deleted from the system:  <br/>
  Use ls command to list the files in the current working directory. <br/>
  Suppose we are looking for someone called jhill. Search the Q2_deleted_users.txt file for the username jhill.

<br />
<br />
5. Suppose we want to find out how many users were added to the Human Resource department in Q4:  <br/>
For shortcut, i used the cat command to list the content of Q4_added_users.txt <br/>
  From there we can see there are 2 users added to the HR department in Q4.
